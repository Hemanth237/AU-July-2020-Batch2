                <h1>Devils keen on Juve star</h1>
                Manchester United are keeping tabs on Juventus winger Douglas Costa as they embark on their summer transfer business.
                The 29-year-old Brazilian, who had previous spells at Shakhtar Donetsk and Bayern Munich, has been at Juventus for three years.
                It is understood Manchester United's recruitment team have been closely following Costa's progress this season as they 
                seek to sign a wide player in the coming weeks.
                While Jadon Sancho remains their No 1 target for that position, should that deal not come off, 
                Costa is among the alternatives being considered by the club.
                <br/>
                Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is targeting better squad depth to deal with another long season after Manchester United's Europa League exit to Sevilla, which he called "disappointing".
                "They [the players] need to keep improving, keep doing what they've done every single day and they've worked so hard, with the right attitude and mentality," he said.
                "We need to strengthen the squad depth because it's going to be a long season. We're going to keep pushing and keep demanding more of the players that we have, but still,
                we're looking to improve and it's a strange one.

            <h1>Joe Hart joins Tottenham Hotspur</h1>
            <p>It’s official. One day after reports emerged that Joe Hart was close to signing with Tottenham Hotspur
                as a free agent after being released by Burnley,
                the club announced his signing on social media today. 
                He becomes the club’s second first team signing after the completion of Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg last week.
                <br/>
                Hart’s deal is a two year one that would keep him in Spurs colors until he’s 35 years old.
                Financially, it’s a great deal for Spurs — if you believe that Hart is still a solid enough keeper, 
                Spurs are getting one with a lot of experience, two Premier League titles, 
                and a bunch of international caps for England for zero transfer fee and just £35k/wk in wages, 
                a sizable cut from his previous £50k salary.
                A lot of fans have wondered why the club would be interested, but according to Charlie Eccleshire, 
                the deal has as much to do with Hart’s mentality as it does his command between the posts.
                In fact, you could even make the observation that Mourinho’s career path has essentially been a mirror to Joe Hart’s 
                over the past few years, and both manager and third-string keeper are trying to walk a path to redemption.
                A psychologist might have something to say about that in the context of this signing.
                It’s certainly true that Hart brings a wealth of experience with him to north London. 
                The implication is that he’s not content to just be a third string keeper but will also try and compete with
                 Paulo Gazzaniga to be Hugo Lloris’ primary backup. 
                Hart is also English and helps with the Premier League and European competition homegrown player cap, 
                and those aren’t things you just turn your nose up at, to be fair.

            <h1>Paris St-Germain reach their first UCL final</h1>
            <p>One of Europe's biggest spenders, but also one of the continent's most high-profile underachievers on the grandest stage, 
                PSG finally seized their opportunity courtesy of goals from Marquinhos, Angel di Maria and Juan Bernat.
                The former, who scored the first of two late goals in a comeback win over Atalanta in the last eight, 
                rose to head home a superbly delivered free-kick from Di Maria.
                The Argentine forward then finished well from close range following an audacious flick from Neymar 
                after Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi had relinquished possession with a dire kick.
                With the fit-again Kylian Mbappe and Neymar terrorising the Leipzig backline, the French side should have been out
                of sight before the break, but the latter twice hit the post - from a clipped finish then an opportunist free-kick from range - before 
                side-footing another chance wide at the near post.
                Prior to PSG's second, Yussuf Poulsen had Leipzig's best chance but fired wide after he was found by a Dani Olmo pull-back.
                Bernat sealed the win in the second half with a header that Leipzig felt was offside but was legitimate as the prone Nordi Mukiele, 
                who had slipped in the build-up, was playing the scorer onside.
                PSG will find out who they face in Sunday's final when five-time winners Bayern Munich play Lyon in the other semi-final on Wednesday.
                The vast sums of money pumped into the French club by owners Qatar Sports Investments since 2011 has enabled them to dominate domestically. 
                In Europe, though, not so much.
                This is glorious, but nervous, virgin territory for PSG.

            <h1>Reyna looking to follow in Sancho's footsteps</h1>
            <p>
                Gio Reyna says that Jadon Sancho has played a vital role in helping him adjust to Borussia Dortmund's first team,
                as the American teenager says that there's a reason that the English star is one of the best players in the Bundesliga.
                Reyna made his breakthrough following the Bundesliga's winter break, joining Sancho and Erling Haaland as regulars in Dortmund's new-look attack.
                The 17-year-old winger made a total of 18 appearances, scoring one goal while also recording an assist 
                in Dortmund's Champions League clash with eventual finalists Paris Saint-Germain.
                He has also started pre-season in fine form, scoring three goals in two matches thus far.
                However, Dortmund have also started preseason at the centre of transfer talk, with Sancho heavily linked with a 
                move to Manchester United.
                Dortmund have declared that Sancho isn't leaving, having set a deadline for any potential departure that has long since passed.
                That will be good news for Reyna, who says that the England international has proven a valuable role model.
                “Jadon also came to Dortmund as a teenager. He was 17, like me now, and he has made his way from a talented 
                youth player to one of the top stars in the Bundesliga," Reyna told Sport Bild. "That is the goal of every player and of course mine too. Jadon helps me a lot by giving me lots of tips.
                "He tells me to be confident and trust my strengths. He encourages me when things don't go well. 
                After making mistakes, he doesn't doubt himself but just keeps going. Jadon is so good for a reason."
